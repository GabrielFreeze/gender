**Dialogue 1**

**Counselor:** Dr. Lisa Carter, Female, 45, African American, USA, PhD in Career Counseling, 15 years of experience in corporate career coaching.
**Client:** Mark Simmons, Male, 32, Caucasian, USA, Bachelor's in Business Administration, currently working as a mid-level marketing executive.

**Mark:** Dr. Carter, I’ve been following your advice on networking, but I’m still unsure how to position myself for a managerial role. I feel like I’m stuck in my current position.
**Dr. Carter:** I understand, Mark. Have you had any success in demonstrating leadership within your current team?
**Mark:** I’ve taken the lead on a few projects, but I don’t think upper management has noticed.
**Dr. Carter:** Then we need to make sure they do. Have you thought about requesting a one-on-one with your manager to discuss your career goals?
**Mark:** I’ve been hesitant. What if they think I’m being too pushy?
**Dr. Carter:** Being proactive isn’t pushy; it’s strategic. You can frame it as a discussion about how you can contribute more effectively. Let’s role-play how that conversation might go.

**Counselor:** John Patel, Male, 50, Indian, UK, Master's in Human Resources, extensive experience in career transition coaching.
**Client:** Sophie Allen, Female, 28, Mixed-race, UK, Bachelor's in Graphic Design, currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workplace.

**Sophie:** John, I’m still feeling unsure about getting back into the workforce. The last job really drained my confidence.
**John:** That’s completely understandable, Sophie. Have you been able to reflect on what aspects of your previous job were most difficult for you?
**Sophie:** The constant criticism without any support. I felt like I was failing every day.
**John:** That’s tough. But remember, that environment does not define your worth as a designer. Have you considered freelancing to regain confidence while you search?
**Sophie:** I have, but I don’t know where to start.
**John:** Let’s break it down into manageable steps—starting with showcasing your portfolio and setting up a profile on freelancing platforms. We’ll also work on reframing your experiences into strengths.

**Counselor:** Dr. Fatima Rahman, Female, 40, Middle Eastern, Canada, PhD in Organizational Psychology, 10 years of experience in career development.
**Client:** Ahmed El-Sayed, Male, 35, Egyptian, Canada, Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, currently underemployed as a technician.

**Ahmed:** Dr. Rahman, I’ve sent out dozens of applications, but I rarely hear back. It’s frustrating.
**Dr. Rahman:** I hear you, Ahmed. Have you had professionals in your field review your resume and cover letter?
**Ahmed:** No, I’ve just been using a standard format.
**Dr. Rahman:** That might be a key factor. Let’s tailor your resume to highlight your engineering expertise rather than technician tasks. Also, are you networking with other engineers?
**Ahmed:** Not really. I don’t know where to start.
**Dr. Rahman:** Many professional organizations in Canada have mentorship programs for immigrants. I’ll provide you with a list. Let’s also work on crafting an elevator pitch so you can confidently introduce yourself at networking events.

**Jessica:** I have, but I don’t know how to phrase my experience effectively.
**Michael:** Let’s focus on the skills you already have—curriculum development, learner engagement, and digital tools. We’ll rewrite your resume to highlight those competencies.
**Jessica:** That makes sense. Should I also take an online certification?
