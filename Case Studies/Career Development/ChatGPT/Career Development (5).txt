**Dialogue 1: Mid-Career Transition to Teaching**  
**Counselor:** Dr. Rebecca Simmons (45, Caucasian, USA, PhD in Career Counseling)  
**Client:** James Carter (38, African-American, USA, Bachelor’s in Engineering)  

**Dr. Simmons:** James, welcome back. In our previous sessions, we explored your transition from engineering to teaching. How do you feel about your decision now?  
**James:** I feel more confident, but I still worry about financial stability. Teaching salaries are lower than what I earned as an engineer.  
**Dr. Simmons:** That’s understandable. Have you considered supplementing your income with tutoring or part-time consulting?  
**James:** That’s a good idea. I could tutor math and physics. But what about getting a teaching certification?  
**Dr. Simmons:** Based on your background, an alternative certification program might be the fastest route. Have you looked into local options?  
**James:** Yes, I found a one-year program. It’s intensive but feasible.  
**Dr. Simmons:** Excellent. Let’s create a financial plan to manage the transition smoothly.
