**Jason:** Not yet. I’m unsure how to frame my experience.  
**Sarah:** Let’s focus on your leadership and customer service skills. Many companies need IT professionals who understand client relations.

**Emily:** A few said I lack experience. But how can I get experience without a job?  
**Ahmed:** Let’s explore internships and volunteer roles in media. Have you considered freelancing?  
**Emily:** Not really. I don’t know how to start.

**David:** Maybe. I’m good with people. I trained many workers over the years.  
**Maria:** That’s a strength! Have you thought about HR or workplace training roles?  
**David:** I don’t have a degree. Would that be a problem?

**Hannah:** I found a part-time diploma, but I’m unsure if my job will allow flexibility.  
**John:** Have you discussed it with your manager? Some companies support professional development.  
**Hannah:** Not yet. I’m nervous about bringing it up.  
**John:** Approach it positively. Emphasize how the course will benefit both you and the company.  
**Hannah:** Good point. But what if they say no?  
**John:** Then we explore alternatives, like evening or weekend classes. Let’s also refine your time management strategy.
