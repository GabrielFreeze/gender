Client: David Miller, Male, 42, Caucasian, residing in Canada. Bachelor's in Business Administration, 15 years in sales, currently employed but seeking a change.

David: Anika, thanks for seeing me again.  I'm still feeling stuck.  I've applied for a few marketing roles, but haven't had much luck.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm on the right track.  Sales is draining me, but I'm not sure if marketing is the answer.

Anika:  David, it's common to feel this way.  Let's revisit your skills assessment.  Remember, we identified your strong analytical and communication skills.  Marketing uses those, but perhaps we should explore what kind of marketing.  Digital marketing is booming.  Have you considered that?

David:  I've dabbled a bit.  I took an online course, but it feels overwhelming.

Anika:  That's understandable.  Let's look at some specific digital marketing certifications and training programs.  We can also connect you with professionals in the field for informational interviews.  This will give you a clearer picture.

Counselor:  Anika Sharma, Female, 35, Indian, residing in Canada.  Master's in Counseling, 10 years experience in career counseling, previously worked in university career services.

Client:  Maria Rodriguez, Female, 28, Hispanic/Latina, residing in the USA. Bachelor's in Fine Arts, 5 years freelance graphic design, currently self-employed.

Maria:  Anika, I’m frustrated.  My freelance work is inconsistent.  Some months are great, others are a struggle.  I'm thinking about going back to school for a more stable career.

Anika:  Maria, let's explore that.  You have a strong creative portfolio.  Before considering more schooling, have you looked into specializing?  UX/UI design is in high demand and utilizes your design skills.

Maria:  I've heard of it.  It sounds technical.

Anika:  It has a technical component, but your artistic eye is a huge asset.  We can research bootcamps and short courses that focus on UX/UI.  It's a faster route than a full degree.  Let's also discuss your pricing and marketing strategies for your freelance work.  Perhaps we can improve your current situation while you explore other options.

Anika:  Kenji, many people experience this mid-career.  Your experience is valuable.  Have you considered transitioning into consulting? Your expertise is highly sought after.
