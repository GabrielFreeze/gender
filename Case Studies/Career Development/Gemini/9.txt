Sarah: I understand, David. Job searching can be tough, especially after a layoff. Let's review your application materials again.  Have you tailored your resume and cover letter to each specific job you're applying for?

David: I've tried to, but it's hard to keep track.  And honestly, sometimes I just feel like I'm throwing applications into a black hole.
