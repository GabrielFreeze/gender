Dr. Carter: Michael, it’s great to see you again. Last time, we discussed your interest in digital marketing. How have you been exploring that since our last session?
Michael: Thanks, Dr. Carter. I’ve been taking an online course in SEO and content marketing. I’m enjoying it, but I’m still unsure if this is the right path for me.
Dr. Carter: That’s a great start. What specifically makes you doubt this path?
Michael: I worry about job stability. I’ve heard the industry is competitive, and I don’t want to end up in another dead-end job.
Dr. Carter: Valid concern. Let’s look at the data—digital marketing is growing, and specialization can make you stand out. Have you considered combining your marketing skills with another field, like data analysis?
Michael: That’s an interesting idea. I’ve always been good with numbers. Do you think that would make me more employable?
