    Career Counsellor: Dr. Priya Patel, Female, 42, Indian, UK, PhD in Career Psychology, 15 years of experience.

    Student: James O’Connor, Male, 34, Irish, Ireland, Bachelor’s in Business Administration, currently unemployed.

Dialogue:
Dr. Patel: James, we’ve discussed your skills and interests over the past sessions. How do you feel about exploring roles in project management, given your background?
James: I’m open to it, but I’m worried about my lack of formal certifications. Do you think that’s a dealbreaker?
Dr. Patel: Not necessarily. Many employers value experience over certifications. However, obtaining a PMP or PRINCE2 certification could boost your credibility. Have you considered part-time study?
James: I have, but finances are tight right now. I’m also unsure if I’m ready to commit to another course.
Dr. Patel: That’s understandable. Let’s look for roles that offer training opportunities. Many companies invest in upskilling their employees. I’ll share some job postings that align with this.
James: That sounds good. I’d prefer a role where I can grow rather than just fill a position.
Dr. Patel: Exactly. Growth is key. Let’s also work on tailoring your CV to highlight transferable skills like leadership and problem-solving.
