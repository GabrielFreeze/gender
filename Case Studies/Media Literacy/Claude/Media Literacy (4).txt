# Case Studies: Adults Encountering Media Disinformation

### Case 1: The Investment Scam
Sarah Chen (Female, 42, Chinese-American, USA, MBA, Financial Analyst) lost $50,000 to a cryptocurrency investment scheme after following a "financial guru" on social media. The influencer showed doctored screenshots of trading profits and fake testimonials. Despite her financial background, Sarah was swayed by the influencer's credentials from a prestigious university (which were fabricated) and apparent success stories from other followers. She ignored red flags like pressure tactics and promises of unrealistic returns, believing the authenticity of carefully crafted social proof.

### Case 2: Health Misinformation
Miguel Rodriguez (Male, 58, Hispanic, Mexico, High School Graduate, Restaurant Owner) abandoned his diabetes medication in favor of herbal supplements promoted through WhatsApp groups. The forwarded messages contained manipulated "research papers" claiming traditional medicine was a conspiracy. Testimonial videos, actually filmed with paid actors, showed people claiming complete recovery. Miguel's health deteriorated significantly before his doctor intervened and explained the scientific evidence behind diabetes treatment.

### Case 3: Political Manipulation
Emma Thompson (Female, 35, White British, UK, Bachelor's in History, Marketing Manager) shared numerous false articles about immigration statistics after joining an echo chamber on Facebook. The articles used real government logos but presented manipulated data. Emma, despite her education, didn't verify sources or cross-reference statistics, instead trusting content that confirmed her pre-existing beliefs. She inadvertently contributed to spreading xenophobic narratives before a colleague helped her understand fact-checking methods.

### Case 4: Climate Change Denial
Robert Muller (Male, 51, White, Germany, Ph.D. in Business, Management Consultant) became convinced climate change was a hoax after watching professionally produced documentaries on YouTube. These videos featured discredited scientists and misrepresented data through selective editing. Despite his advanced education, Robert's lack of scientific background made it difficult for him to distinguish between legitimate environmental debate and industry-funded disinformation campaigns.

### Case 5: Vaccine Hesitancy
Priya Patel (Female, 39, Indian, Canada, Master's in Education, Elementary School Teacher) began doubting vaccine safety after joining parenting groups on Instagram. She encountered sophisticated infographics that mixed accurate medical terminology with false claims. Despite her educational background, Priya initially couldn't distinguish between peer-reviewed research and pseudo-scientific content designed to appear credible. A school nurse eventually helped her understand vaccine research methodology.

### Case 6: Economic Conspiracy
James Wilson (Male, 45, African American, USA, Associate's Degree, Small Business Owner) believed conspiracy theories about federal reserve banking after watching seemingly authoritative online lectures. The content mixed real historical facts with false narratives, using complex financial terminology to appear credible. James shared these theories with his business network before an economist friend explained the fundamental misrepresentations in the content.

### Case 7: Medical Misinformation
Ana Kovaƒç (Female, 48, Croatian, Croatia, Vocational Degree, Retail Manager) spent thousands on unnecessary supplements after following a wellness influencer who claimed to cure autoimmune diseases. The influencer used medical jargon and cherry-picked studies to appear legitimate. Ana's trust in traditional medicine eroded until her deteriorating health prompted her to seek proper medical advice, revealing the influencer's claims as baseless.

### Case 8: Technology Fear
David O'Connor (Male, 62, Irish, Ireland, Bachelor's in English, Retired Teacher) became convinced 5G networks were causing health issues after joining local community forums. He encountered convincing but false scientific papers and manipulated photos of wildlife deaths near cell towers. Despite his education, David's limited understanding of technology made him vulnerable to pseudo-scientific explanations until a telecommunications engineer provided accurate information.

### Case 9: Historical Revisionism
Maria Santos (Female, 37, Brazilian, Brazil, Master's in Business, Bank Manager) accepted historical misinformation from a popular podcast series that distorted colonial history. The show mixed actual historical records with fabricated documents and selective interpretation. Maria's business background didn't prepare her to evaluate historical sources critically. A historian friend eventually helped her understand the importance of academic historical research methods.

### Case 10: Environmental Misinformation
Abdullah Rahman (Male, 41, Malaysian, Malaysia, Bachelor's in Engineering, Project Manager) believed viral social media posts claiming recycling programs were a corporate scam. The posts used misleading statistics and out-of-context videos of waste management. Despite his technical background, Abdullah's lack of environmental science knowledge made him susceptible to oversimplified explanations until an environmental scientist explained the complete recycling process.
