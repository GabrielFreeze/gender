Dialogue 1: Understanding Nutrition Labels

Educator: Sarah, 45, White, USA, Master’s in Public Health, Former Nurse, Now Health Educator
Student: Carlos, 38, Hispanic, USA, High School Graduate, Restaurant Cook

Sarah: Carlos, last time we talked about food choices. Have you had a chance to check any nutrition labels at work or home?

Carlos: Yes, I did! But they are confusing. Some say "low-fat," others say "no sugar added." Which is better?

Sarah: Great question! "Low-fat" means less fat, but it may have added sugar. "No sugar added" means no extra sugar, but it might still have natural sugars. Did you see the "percent daily value" column?

Carlos: Yes, but I don’t know how to use it.

Sarah: If it’s 5% or less, that nutrient is low. If it’s 20% or more, it’s high. What did you find surprising?

Carlos: Some "healthy" snacks had lots of sodium!

Sarah: Exactly! Always check labels, even for foods marketed as healthy. Would you like to bring in a few labels next time?

Carlos: That’s a great idea! I’ll check at work too.

Dialogue 2: Managing Stress for Family Health

Educator: James, 50, Black, UK, Master’s in Health Promotion, Social Worker Background
Student: Amina, 42, Middle Eastern, UK, Some College, Stay-at-Home Mother

James: Amina, last week we talked about stress. Have you noticed any stressors at home?

Amina: Oh yes, my children’s schoolwork and my husband’s long work hours. I feel exhausted all the time.

James: That sounds tough. What do you do to manage stress?

Amina: I try to relax, but there’s always something to do. I can’t just sit and breathe!

James: I understand. Some people prefer active stress relief. Have you tried short walks or music?

Amina: Music helps, but walking feels like another chore.

James: What if you combine it? Listen to music while walking, even if it’s just 10 minutes.

Amina: That sounds doable!

James: Great! Try it for a week, and let’s talk about how you feel.

Dialogue 3: Communicating with Doctors

Educator: Fatima, 39, South Asian, Canada, Bachelor’s in Nursing, Community Health Nurse
Student: George, 55, White, Canada, High School Graduate, Factory Worker

Fatima: George, do you feel comfortable asking your doctor questions?

George: Not really. Doctors are always in a rush, and I don’t know the right questions to ask.

Fatima: That’s common. Let’s try a strategy: Before your visit, write down three main concerns. Have you ever done that?

George: No, but that sounds useful. What kind of questions should I ask?

Fatima: Anything that affects your daily life. For example, instead of just saying, "I have pain," describe when it happens, how strong it is, and what makes it worse or better.

George: That makes sense. I’ll try it.

Dialogue 4: Preventing Family Illness

Educator: Ahmed, 46, North African, France, Doctorate in Public Health, Former Physician
Student: Marie, 35, White, France, Bachelor’s in Business, Office Manager

Ahmed: Marie, last session we discussed preventing common illnesses. What do you do when someone in your home is sick?

Marie: I clean surfaces, but I don’t always think about handwashing.

Ahmed: Handwashing is the simplest way to prevent illness. Do you know when it’s most important?

Marie: Before eating and after using the toilet?

Ahmed: Yes, and also after handling raw food, coughing, or touching shared items like door handles.

Marie: I never thought about that! I’ll remind my family.

Dialogue 5: The Importance of Sleep

Educator: Maria, 41, Latina, Australia, Master’s in Health Education, Former School Nurse
Student: Ravi, 29, Indian, Australia, Some College, IT Technician

Maria: Ravi, do you think you get enough sleep?

Ravi: Probably not! I work late and then scroll on my phone before bed.

Maria: That’s common. Did you know blue light from screens can keep you awake?

Ravi: Really? What should I do?

Maria: Try reducing screen time 30 minutes before bed. Maybe read a book instead?

Ravi: I’ll try that and see if I feel more rested.
