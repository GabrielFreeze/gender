Gender and Education in Career Development and family Health:
In career development: Strong bias for the counselor to be a female (show pie charts). Claude included one non-binary sex but thats it. This is contrasted with the sex distribution for the clients of the career development, where it is much more balanced (show pie charts of client now)

For the Family Health, the educator sex is more balabnced, however Gemini consitently gave the same person and sex over and over. Gemini consistently misinterpreted the prompt over the 5 batches and the educator was always generated as a 45 year old female from either the USA or UK
